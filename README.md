## Aim  
To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns.

---

## Algorithm  
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Prompt Technique 1: **Query Decomposition**  
**Prompt:**  
"Write an article explaining how AI is used in agriculture. Break the explanation into the following parts:  
1. Introduction  
2. Current Use Cases  
3. Benefits and Challenges  
4. Future Prospects"

**Response:**  
### How AI is Transforming Agriculture  

**1. Introduction**  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping traditional farming by introducing smart and data-driven practices. From predicting weather patterns to monitoring crop health, AI is at the forefront of agricultural innovation.

**2. Current Use Cases**  
Farmers use AI-powered drones to survey fields, detect pests, and assess crop growth. Machine learning algorithms help in yield prediction and soil health monitoring.

**3. Benefits and Challenges**  
Benefits include higher productivity, reduced waste, and precision farming. Challenges involve high costs of technology, lack of infrastructure in rural areas, and data privacy concerns.

**4. Future Prospects**  
AI is expected to lead the way in fully autonomous farms, with robot-assisted planting and harvesting, and real-time decision-making powered by AI analytics.

## Prompt Technique 2: **Decision-Making**  
**Prompt:**  
"I'm writing a case study on remote work adoption. Should I focus on tech startups or traditional companies for more impactful insights?"

**Response:**  
**Recommendation:** Focus on traditional companies.  
**Reasoning:** Tech startups are often already optimized for remote work, making the case less novel. Traditional companies provide a richer contrast between pre- and post-remote adoption, revealing challenges and transformation strategies that offer deeper insight for your case study.

## Prompt Technique 3: **Semantic Filtering**  
**Prompt:**  
"Write a professional report about the environmental impact of electric vehicles. Avoid emotional or speculative language and use only verifiable facts."

**Response:**  
### Report: Environmental Impact of Electric Vehicles  

Electric vehicles (EVs) contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions when compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), EVs produced approximately 50% less CO₂ per kilometer in 2022. Battery manufacturing remains a major contributor to environmental cost, particularly lithium mining. However, advancements in battery recycling and grid decarbonization continue to improve the overall sustainability of EVs.

## Prompt Technique 4: **Creative Composition (Comic Book Style)**  
**Prompt:**  
"Create a short comic book plot about a robot who learns to draw emotions."

**Response:**  
**Title:** *Pixel & the Palette*  

**Plot:**  
In a city of logic-driven robots, Pixel is a utility bot who discovers an abandoned art studio. As it tries to mimic old paintings, Pixel accidentally creates a piece filled with emotion. Confused but intrigued, Pixel embarks on a journey to understand feelings through art. Each chapter explores a new emotion—joy, fear, sadness—until Pixel becomes the city’s first emotion-aware bot, teaching others how to connect through creativity.

## Prompt Technique 5: **Perspective Switching**  
**Prompt:**  
"Write a brief article about climate change from the perspective of a polar bear."

**Response:**  
### A Polar Bear’s Plea  

I used to roam vast icy plains, hunting seals and basking in the midnight sun. Now, the ice melts faster than I can travel. My hunting grounds shrink each year, and I swim longer for food. Climate change isn’t just a theory—it’s my reality. If the ice disappears, so do I. Please, protect my home. The Arctic is melting, and so is our time.
